<h1>Python Miscellaneous</h1>
<p>Day-1 : Revising Sets and Solving Collatz Sequence </p>
<p>This is the Practice Question From Python</p>
<p> Write a function named collatz() that has one parameter named number. If
number is even, then collatz() should print number // 2 and return this value.
If number is odd, then collatz() should print and return 3 * number + 1.
Then write a program that lets the user type in an integer and that keeps
calling collatz() on that number until the function returns the value 1.
(Amazingly enough, this sequence actually works for any integer—sooner
or later, using this sequence, you’ll arrive at 1! Even mathematicians aren’t
sure why. Your program is exploring what’s called the Collatz sequence, sometimes
called “the simplest impossible math problem.”)</p>

<h4> Add try and except statements to the previous project to detect whether the
user types in a noninteger string. Normally, the int() function will raise a
ValueError error if it is passed a noninteger string, as in int('puppy'). In the
except clause, print a message to the user saying they must enter an integer.</h4>
